This document refers to the paper **“Spiking Neural P Systems and Kernel P Systems”** and the folder **Examples/LogicalGate**, which consists of four subfolders and the file **LogicalGateModelDiagram**. This diagram corresponds to Example 1, pages 9-11, from the paper (Fig. 1 coincides with the Diagram 1). The other examples from the paper and the experiments related to the testing and verification section are described below.

## Example 1

Example 1, depicted in the diagram, refers to a spiking neural P system (SN P system) with 10 neurons, computing the logical expression **((x ∨ y) ∧ z) ∧ (x ∨ z)**, where x, y, z are Boolean variables (1-true, 0-false). Their values will be inputted in the input neurons, as described in the paper.

## [Examples/LogicalGate](Examples/LogicGate) Subfolders Description

- **[Models](Examples/LogicGate/Models)**: Contains the three spiking neural P systems presented in:
  - **LogicalGate**: kP-lingua description corresponding to the kP system from Example 1 (built for the SN P system from Fig. 1).
  - **LogicalGateDelay**: kP-lingua description corresponding to the kP system built for the SN P system from Fig. 2.
  - **LogicalGatePolarization**: kP-lingua description corresponding to the kP system built for the SN P system from Fig. 3.

- **[Traces](Examples/LogicGate/Traces)**: Contains traces of execution (running the kP systems corresponding to the SN P system represented in Fig. 1) for all possible input values of x, y, z (8 values, from 0,0,0 to 1,1,1).

- **[Testing](Examples/LogicGate/Testing)**: Contains 4 files:
  - **_Rules**: The rule and list of rule combinations.
  - **DFA_transition_table**: Transition table of the deterministic finite automaton obtained by using the learning algorithm with bounded sequences of length up to 4; the labels a..s correspond to combinations of rules applied.
  - **DFA Diagram**: The diagram corresponding to the transition table.
  - **Computed U set**: Test set with test sequences related to the SN P system model in Fig. 1, computed based on the DFA constructed (provided in the two files above).
  - **TestingMutants**: Contains test sequences applied in the case of errors in the implementation of the SN P systems, given by mutants.

- **[Verification](Examples/LogicGate/Verification)**: Contains 3 files:
  - **NuSMV Model**: The NuSMV model generated by kPWorkbench from the kP system built from the SN P system in Fig. 1.
  - **Properties**: The properties of the logical gate model in Table 5.
  - **Properties Verification Results**: The properties specified in LTL and CTL and their results
