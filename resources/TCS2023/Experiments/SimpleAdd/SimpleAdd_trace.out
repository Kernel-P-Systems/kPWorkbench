Initial Configuration
-------------------------------------------------
TYPE In1
#0 in1 [Active] {2a} Links to #: 1
TYPE Add
#1 add [Active] {} Links to #: 0, 2, 3
TYPE In2
#2 in2 [Active] {3a} Links to #: 1
TYPE Environment
#3 environment [Active] {} Links to #: 1
-------------------------------------------------

STEP 1

Rule #1 * >=2a: 2a -> {2a}(Add) * applied in instance #0 in1.
Selected instance #1 as target of type Add for rule #1.
Rule #4 * >=2a: 2a -> {2a}(Add) * applied in instance #2 in2.
Selected instance #1 as target of type Add for rule #4.

Configuration #1
-------------------------------------------------
TYPE In1
#0 in1 [Active] {} Links to #: 1
TYPE Add
#1 add [Active] {4a} Links to #: 0, 2, 3
TYPE In2
#2 in2 [Active] {a} Links to #: 1
TYPE Environment
#3 environment [Active] {} Links to #: 1
-------------------------------------------------

STEP 2

Rule #3 * =a: a -> {a}(Add) * applied in instance #2 in2.
Selected instance #1 as target of type Add for rule #3.

Configuration #2
-------------------------------------------------
TYPE In1
#0 in1 [Active] {} Links to #: 1
TYPE Add
#1 add [Active] {5a} Links to #: 0, 2, 3
TYPE In2
#2 in2 [Active] {} Links to #: 1
TYPE Environment
#3 environment [Active] {} Links to #: 1
-------------------------------------------------

STEP 3

Rule #2 * =5a: a -> {a}(Environment) * applied in instance #1 add.
Selected instance #3 as target of type Environment for rule #2.

Configuration #3
-------------------------------------------------
TYPE In1
#0 in1 [Active] {} Links to #: 1
TYPE Add
#1 add [Active] {4a} Links to #: 0, 2, 3
TYPE In2
#2 in2 [Active] {} Links to #: 1
TYPE Environment
#3 environment [Active] {a} Links to #: 1
-------------------------------------------------
System halted at step 3 (no further rule could be applied, i.e. reached a deadlock).
Simulation complete at step 3.
